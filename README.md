## Working Flow !!

- **Create Event**: Users can easily Create their Tickets for the events.

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each ticket is represented as a unique digital asset called an NFT (non-fungible token), ensuring it has its own digital identity that can't be replicated or divided.

- **Buy and Resell**: Anyone can buy these Ticket products from the  event owner, and once someone owns an NFT, they can resell it to others.

- **Experience Gather**: Participant can  share  their experience  after the events ends. So that other users can get  the idea  of the event 



## Substream Integeration 

- SUbstream work is to make the query more faster and reliable than the The Graph.


The code can be found here in this directory: https://github.com/Vikash-8090-Yadav/TickTicket/blob/main/sbsticket/subgraph.yaml

substream as Kind mentioned in ``` subgraph.yaml``` indicates that all the query from subgraph are being handled  & processed by Substream
